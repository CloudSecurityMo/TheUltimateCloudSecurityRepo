## 🔁 SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)

**What is it?**  
SAML is an XML-based protocol used for Single Sign-On (SSO), mainly in enterprise environments. It allows identity providers to pass authorization credentials to service providers.

**Analogy:**  
Going to a nightclub with a **VIP wristband** from a trusted hotel. The wristband lets you skip the ID check at every venue that trusts the hotel.

---

## 🔓 OAuth 2.0 (Authorization Framework)

**What is it?**  
OAuth 2.0 lets third-party apps access your data without getting your password. It issues tokens to apps, allowing limited access.

**Analogy:**  
Giving a **valet ticket** to someone to access your car—but not the keys. They can park it but can’t drive away with it.

---

## 👤 OpenID Connect (OIDC)

**What is it?**  
OIDC is built on OAuth 2.0 and adds identity verification. It tells the service **who the user is**, not just what they can access.

**Analogy:**  
Showing your **driver’s license** to prove who you are when picking up a package.

---

## 🎫 Kerberos

**What is it?**  
A secure protocol that uses tickets for authenticating users on a network. Widely used in Windows environments.

**Analogy:**  
Getting a **visitor badge** at a security desk, which you then show to enter various rooms in a building.

---

## 🔐 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

**What is it?**  
MFA combines two or more authentication methods—like a password and a fingerprint—for stronger security.

**Analogy:**  
Logging into a bank account with a **card (have)**, a **PIN (know)**, and optionally a **face scan (are)**.

---

## 🌐 RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service)

**What is it?**  
A protocol used for centralizing authentication (e.g., Wi-Fi, VPN) across devices or locations.

**Analogy:**  
Checking in at any gym branch, where the front desk contacts a **central database** to confirm your membership.

---

## 🗂️ LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)

**What is it?**  
LDAP reads and writes data from a directory service, often used for authentication via Active Directory.

**Analogy:**  
Looking someone up in a **company address book** to verify their department and title.

---

## 🔑 FIDO2 / WebAuthn

**What is it?**  
A passwordless authentication protocol using public-key cryptography. Utilizes built-in devices like fingerprint readers.

**Analogy:**  
Unlocking your phone with your **fingerprint**—no need for a passcode.

---

## 🧾 TACACS+ (Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus)

**What is it?**  
Used for authenticating and authorizing access to network devices. More granular than RADIUS.

**Analogy:**  
Passing through **three checkpoints** in a building: one to verify identity, one to check access rights, and one to log your entry.

---

## 👁️ Biometric Authentication

**What is it?**  
Uses unique physical characteristics (fingerprints, facial recognition) to authenticate.

**Analogy:**  
Like using a **retina scanner** to open a vault—your body is your password.

---

## 📌 Summary

- **SAML, OAuth, OIDC** = Modern web auth flows
- **Kerberos, RADIUS, LDAP, TACACS+** = Enterprise and network environments
- **MFA, FIDO2, Biometrics** = Strong identity verification

For developers and security professionals, understanding when to use each method is key to designing secure systems.
